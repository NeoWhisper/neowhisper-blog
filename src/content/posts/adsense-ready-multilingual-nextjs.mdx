AdSense doesn't reject you because of your code. It rejects you because your site looks like a ghost town.

"Low value content" is Google's polite way of saying your site lacks trust, depth, and consistency.

Here is the exact playbook we use to turn a multilingual Next.js 16 site into something AdSense approves and humans actually read.

---

<Step number="1" title="Build Real Trust Pages First">

This is non-negotiable. Before you write a single blog post, build these pages and link them in your footer:

- **Privacy Policy & Terms**: Don't use lorem ipsum.
- **About Us**: Write three clear paragraphs about who you are.
- **Contact**: Make sure the [contact form](/contact) actually works.

If you have a language toggle (EN/JA/AR), these pages must be localized too. A broken link in a translated footer is an immediate trust killer.

</Step>

<Step number="2" title="Publish Depth, Not Stubs">

You need 5–10 "anchor articles" (800–1500 words) that solve real problems. Don't publish 50 thin pages; publish 5 great ones.

**A good starter set for a tech studio:**

1.  ["Localized Next.js App Router without breaking SEO"](/blog/nextjs-16-tutorial)
2.  "Privacy-first analytics with GA4 and CSP"
3.  "Production contact forms with Turnstile and Resend"

Each article needs a problem statement, a solution, code snippets, and a clear call to action.

</Step>

<Step number="3" title="Multilingual SEO That Doesn’t Break UX">

Multilingual sites often fail because they confuse search engines.

<Callout type="warning">

**Critical SEO Tags:**

- **hreflang**: Required for every locale.
- **Canonical**: Keep a single canonical per page (usually EN), or self-localize if the content is fully distinct.
- **Meta/OG**: Translate your meta descriptions. Don't show English descriptions on a Japanese page.

</Callout>

Also, persist the `?lang=` query or path preference. Bouncing a user back to English when they click a link is a UX failure.

</Step>

<Step number="4" title="Ads + CSP Without Breaking the App">

AdSense, GA4, and Turnstile all require specific Content Security Policy (CSP) allowances. A strict policy will block them by default.

Use this baseline for `next.config.ts`:

```txt
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://www.googletagmanager.com https://www.google-analytics.com https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com https://challenges.cloudflare.com;
connect-src 'self' https://www.google-analytics.com https://www.googletagmanager.com https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net https://tpc.googlesyndication.com https://adtrafficquality.google https://*.adtrafficquality.google https://fundingchoicesmessages.google.com https://challenges.cloudflare.com https://*.google.com;
frame-src 'self' https://challenges.cloudflare.com https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net https://tpc.googlesyndication.com https://*.google.com https://adtrafficquality.google https://*.adtrafficquality.google https://fundingchoicesmessages.google.com;
```

</Step>

<Step number="5" title="Performance as a Policy Signal">

Google uses Core Web Vitals as a proxy for site quality.

- **Fonts**: Self-host or use `next/font`.
- **Images**: Always define `width` and `height` to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
- **JS Budget**: Keep heavy interactivity off the main thread.

</Step>
