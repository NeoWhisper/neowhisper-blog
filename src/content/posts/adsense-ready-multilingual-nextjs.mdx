# Shipping an AdSense-Ready, Multilingual Next.js Site: A 2026 Playbook

Google’s “low value content” rejection usually isn’t about ads code—it’s about trust, depth, and consistency. Here’s the exact playbook we use to turn a multilingual Next.js 16 site into something AdSense will approve and readers will keep open.

## 1) Build Real Trust Pages First

- **Privacy, Terms, Contact, About**: These are non-negotiable. Link them in the footer and make sure the contact path actually works (mail + form).
- **Consistent brand voice**: Even legal pages should sound like you. Don’t leave lorem ipsum; write two or three clear paragraphs.
- **Language parity**: If you offer JP/AR toggles, every legal page should at least acknowledge the languages (even if the canonical language is EN).

## 2) Publish Depth, Not Stubs

Aim for 5–10 anchor articles (800–1500 words) that solve real problems. A good starter set for a studio like NeoWhisper:

1. “How to localize a Next.js App Router site for JP/AR without breaking SEO”
2. “Designing privacy-first analytics: GA4, CSP, and consent in 2026”
3. “Shipping production contact forms: Turnstile, Resend, deliverability, and DX”
4. “Multilingual content ops: playbooks for writers, translators, and engineers”
5. “AdSense readiness checklist for single-founder studios”

Each article should include: problem statement, step-by-step fixes, screenshots or diagrams, and a short CTA pointing to your services.

## 3) Multilingual SEO That Doesn’t Break UX

- **hreflang** for every locale and page; include alternates in `sitemap.xml`.
- **Language persistence**: carry `?lang=` in nav/CTA links so users don’t bounce between languages.
- **Meta/OG per locale**: don’t reuse English meta everywhere—write culturally appropriate summaries.
- **Canonical strategy**: keep a single canonical per page (usually EN), but never canonicalize different languages to the same URL.

## 4) Ads + CSP Without Breaking the App

AdSense, GA, and Turnstile all need script/connect/frame allowances. A safe baseline:

```
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://www.googletagmanager.com https://www.google-analytics.com https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com https://challenges.cloudflare.com;
connect-src 'self' https://www.google-analytics.com https://www.googletagmanager.com https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net https://tpc.googlesyndication.com https://adtrafficquality.google https://*.adtrafficquality.google https://fundingchoicesmessages.google.com https://challenges.cloudflare.com;
frame-src 'self' https://challenges.cloudflare.com https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net https://tpc.googlesyndication.com;
```

Keep `object-src 'none'` and `form-action 'self'`. If a script is still blocked, read the console and add only the required host—don’t go wild with `*`.

## 5) Performance Hygiene (because UX is a policy signal)

- **Fonts**: self-host or use `next/font` with fallbacks so builds don’t fail offline. Set `display: swap`.
- **Images**: provide width/height to avoid CLS; compress hero images; lazy-load below the fold.
- **JS budget**: keep heavy components client-only; prefer Server Components for content pages.

## 6) Content Operations That Scale

- **Source of truth**: keep posts in `src/content/posts` (MDX) with consistent frontmatter. Add `coverImage` for every post.
- **Localization workflow**: translate from EN to JP/AR with glossaries; avoid raw machine translation; have a reviewer pass for tone.
- **Review checklist** (per article): title/slug unique, meta description < 160 chars, at least one internal link, one external credible link, hero image with alt text, CTA link to services/contact.

## 7) Deliverability for Contact Forms

- Use a verified domain (SPF + DKIM + DMARC). Set DMARC to `p=quarantine` or `p=reject`.
- Friendly `from`: `hello@yourdomain.com`, `reply_to` set to the user’s email.
- Spam protection: Turnstile on the form, server-side verification, and clear error messages to users.

## 8) A 10-Day Ship Plan

- **Day 1–2**: Write Privacy, Terms, About; wire footer links; verify contact form end-to-end.
- **Day 3–6**: Publish 3 anchor articles (one per day). Include localized summaries.
- **Day 7**: Add hreflang, update sitemap, check CLS/LCP with Lighthouse.
- **Day 8**: Tighten CSP to only the hosts you need; verify no console CSP errors.
- **Day 9**: DMARC/SPF deliverability check; send test emails to multiple inboxes (Gmail/Outlook).
- **Day 10**: Run a full AdSense readiness audit and request review.

## 9) AdSense Review Prep Checklist

- At least 5 substantial articles per locale (or one locale plus clear “single-language” positioning).
- Privacy/Terms/Contact visible in footer; working nav links; no 404s.
- No “coming soon” or empty sections; remove placeholder lorem.
- Ads code optional before approval—consider disabling until approved to reduce noise.
- Clean console: no CSP blocks for AdSense/analytics; no hydration errors.

## 10) Proof of Quality

Include tangible value: code snippets, diagrams, downloadable checklists, or mini case studies (“Reduced CLS from 0.25 to 0.04 by pre-sizing hero images”). The more specific, the less likely Google will consider it “low value.”

**Bottom line:** AdSense approval follows naturally when the site is something you’d bookmark yourself—useful content, trustworthy pages, solid UX, and a frictionless contact path. Ship depth first; ads second.
