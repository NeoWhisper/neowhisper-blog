# Building Your First Next.js 14 Blog

So, you want to build a blog? In 2026, we're not just throwing some HTML on a server anymore. We want speed, we want great SEO, and honestly? We want it to be fun to build.

That's where **Next.js 14** comes in.

In this guide, I'm going to walk you through building a blog that actually feels modern. We're talking Next.js 14, the App Router (yes, it's stable and awesome now), MDX for your content, and Tailwind CSS to make it look sharp.

> "Next.js 14 isn't just an update; it's a whole new way to think about building for the web."

## 🚀 Why Next.js 14?

You might be asking, "Why not just use WordPress?" And look, WordPress is fine. But if you're a developer (or becoming one), you want full control.

Here is why Next.js 14 is the move:

1.  **It's Fast (Like, Really Fast)**: Thanks to **Server Components**, your blog posts render on the server. This means less JavaScript for the user's browser to churn through, which equals instant load times.
2.  **The App Router Rules**: Remember the old `pages` directory? We don't need that anymore. The App Router uses folders for routes, which makes layouts and loading states incredibly intuitive.
3.  **Performance for Free**: Images? Optimized. Fonts? Optimized. It does the heavy lifting so you don't have to.
4.  **TypeScript**: It just works. You get type safety right out of the box, which saves you from so many "undefined is not a function" headaches.

## 🛠️ Let's Get Set Up

Alright, let's get your hands dirty. First things first, make sure you've got Node.js installed (version 18.17 or newer).

Open up your terminal and run this:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest neowhisper-blog
```

It's going to ask you a few questions. Here is my recommended setup:

-   **TypeScript?** Yes (Trust me on this one)
-   **Tailwind CSS?** Yes (Standard in 2026)
-   **App Router?** Yes (The new standard)
-   **Import Alias?** Yes (Use `@/*`, it's cleaner)

### Adding the Secret Sauce (MDX)

We want to write our posts in Markdown but have the power of React components. That's what MDX does. Let's install the dependencies we need:

```bash
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react gray-matter date-fns
npm install -D @types/mdx
```

## 📂 Project Structure

Keep it clean. Here is how I organize my projects:

```text
src/
├── app/              # Your pages live here
├── components/       # Reusable UI bits (like buttons and cards)
├── content/          # Your MDX blog posts go here
└── lib/              # Helper functions (like fetching posts)
```

## 📝 Fetching Your Content

One of the coolest things about the App Router is that you can just... fetch data. You don't need `useEffect` or complex state management for simple data fetching.

### The Home Page

In `src/app/page.tsx`, we can just grab our posts and render them.

```tsx
import { getAllPosts } from '@/lib/posts';
import ArticleCard from '@/components/ArticleCard';

export default async function Home() {
  const posts = await getAllPosts();

  return (
    <main className="container mx-auto px-4 py-12">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Latest Thoughts</h1>
      <div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8">
        {posts.map((post) => (
          <ArticleCard key={post.slug} post={post} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
```

### The Blog Post Page

For the individual posts at `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`, we want them to be static. Why? Because blog posts don't change every second. We can build them once and serve them instantly.

```tsx
import { getPostBySlug, getAllPosts } from '@/lib/posts';
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc';

// This tells Next.js to build these pages in advance
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await getAllPosts();
  return posts.map((post) => ({ slug: post.slug }));
}

export default async function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const post = await getPostBySlug(params.slug);
  if (!post) return <div>404 - Post not found</div>;

  return (
    <article className="max-w-3xl mx-auto py-12">
      <h1 className="text-5xl font-bold mb-4">{post.title}</h1>
      <div className="prose lg:prose-xl dark:prose-invert">
        {/* This is where the magic happens */}
        <MDXRemote source={post.content} />
      </div>
    </article>
  );
}
```

## 🎨 Making It Look Good

Let's build a simple card component for your post previews.

```tsx
// src/components/ArticleCard.tsx
import Link from 'next/link';
import Image from 'next/image';

export default function ArticleCard({ post }: { post: Post }) {
  return (
    <Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`} className="group block">
      <article className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-2xl overflow-hidden shadow-sm hover:shadow-xl transition-all duration-300">
        <div className="relative h-48 w-full">
           <Image
             src={post.coverImage}
             alt={post.title}
             fill
             className="object-cover group-hover:scale-105 transition-transform duration-500"
           />
        </div>
        <div className="p-6">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2 group-hover:text-purple-600 transition-colors">
            {post.title}
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-500 line-clamp-2">{post.excerpt}</p>
        </div>
      </article>
    </Link>
  );
}
```
